# Duke Marine Ecology Lab
### Duke MIDS Class of 2023 Capstone Project

High seas refer to the open ocean that’s not within the territorial waters or jurisdiction of any particular state. They make up about two-thirds of the world’s oceans. High seas support Important industries including fishing, gas exploration, sea mining, and sea shipping, but due to lack of jurisdiction, exploration of high seas lacks consistent and effective oversight. 

This project aims to understand oceanic seasonal patterns at two high seas: the Sargasso Sea and the Cost Rica Thermal Dome. To achieve this, we use datasets from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and analyze oceanic features in these areas that would aid international agencies in developing sustainable resource management plans.

This capstone project is valuable because it provides a large-scale analysis of oceanic features in the Sargasso Sea and Costa Rica Thermal Dome using innovative technology such as cloud computing. Our project will also provide detailed insights into how climate change will impact these areas. This capstone project serves the Duke Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab's new research project in “Contributing to hybrid governance to protect and manage outstanding areas in the high seas.” This project could potentially serve the United Nations in designing conservation policies in the Sargasso Sea and Costa Rica Thermal Dome.

Although the United Nations failed to enact a treaty regarding biodiversity protection on the high seas in the 4th Session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) from 7 to 18 March 2022, it just kicked off the 5th Session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) from 15 to 26 August 2022 aimed at creating a new, legally-binding global treaty to govern use of the high seas.
